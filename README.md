# Welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã

I am currently studying Applied Computer Science at the Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, AGH UST.

Every repository with WFiIS- prefix is a project / lab from my studies. Feel free to check them out!

## Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
I do not support blind copying of someone else's solutions. My projects have been presented strictly as my personal portfolio and studying process.
